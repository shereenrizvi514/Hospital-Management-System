S – Situation:
In my 1st semester of BS Artificial Intelligence, I was assigned a C++ project to build a basic system that could simulate real-world applications. I chose to develop a Hospital Management System.

T – Task:
The goal was to create a C++ program that could manage patient details, doctors' information, and hospital-related functionalities like appointments or record-keeping.

A – Action:
I used object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. I created different classes for doctors (child specialist, gynecologist, general), patients, and appointments. I implemented menu-driven logic using loops and conditional structures in C++ to allow user interaction.

R – Result:
The project was successfully compiled and tested. It helped me understand real-world software logic, apply OOP in C++, and learn basic software structuring. It also laid the foundation for future, more complex systems.
